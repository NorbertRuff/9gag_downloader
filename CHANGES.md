# 9GAG Downloader - Changes

This document outlines the major changes made to the 9GAG Downloader project.

## Structure Improvements

We've restructured the project with a clearer separation of concerns:

1. **Core Business Logic**
   - Created dedicated modules for data models, parsing, and downloading
   - Used dataclasses for better type safety and data representation
   - Improved error handling and robustness

2. **UI Components**
   - Reorganized UI code into dedicated frames and components
   - Improved widget styling and layout
   - Added better keyboard navigation support

3. **Configuration**
   - Separated theme and color configuration
   - Used dataclasses for better configuration organization
   - Made styling more consistent with better theme support

4. **Utilities**
   - Added improved logging with rotation and console output
   - Created reusable helper functions for common operations
   - Added better file path handling with pathlib

## Technical Improvements

The codebase now follows modern Python practices:

1. **Package Structure**
   - Proper Python package structure with `pyproject.toml`
   - Better module organization and imports
   - Clear package boundaries

2. **Type Safety**
   - Comprehensive type annotations throughout
   - Better parameter and return type documentation
   - Use of Optional, Dict, List, etc. for clarity

3. **Documentation**
   - Better docstrings with clear descriptions
   - Args/Returns documentation for all public functions
   - Architecture and structure documentation (STRUCTURE.md)

4. **Code Quality**
   - More consistent naming conventions
   - Better separation of concerns
   - Improved error handling

## Migration Scripts

To help migrate from the old structure:

1. `scripts/migrate_to_pyproject.py` - Migrate from requirements.txt to pyproject.toml
2. `scripts/cleanup.py` - Remove old directories after migration
3. `scripts/create_package.py` - Create a wheel package from the new structure

## Usage Improvements

The application now has:

1. Better validation and error handling
2. More user-friendly file selection
3. Better progress reporting
4. Improved logging
5. Better error messages
